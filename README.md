## ShareX fork differences
Many thanks to ShareX team for such perfect tool! However due to security policies in my company I'm prohibited to use ShareX since it has image upload and OCR features.
So I decided to fork ShareX repo, cut image upload and OCR functionality to meet company's security policies.

<b>Do not use this fork if you are not constrained by security policies!</b>
